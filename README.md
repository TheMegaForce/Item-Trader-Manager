## ITEM MANAGER

For this project, I will make an item manager for a user to get items from a lootcrate.

Have an existing user be able to trade a random assortment of items to be able to gain currency where the item cash value directly corrisponds to it's rarity.

With their items, they can also trade them with a bot to get more valueable items.
